- [x] Health checks for container orchestration
- [x] Image optimization: ~180MB (vs 950MB unoptimized)
- [x] Multi-service Docker Compose stack (app + PostgreSQL + Redis)
- [x] Volume management for data persistence
- [x] Service health checks and dependencies
- [x] Container networking
- [x] Database initialization scripts
