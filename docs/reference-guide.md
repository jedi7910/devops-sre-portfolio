### Job Market Alignment Strategy

**After K8s completion, analyze:**
1. **Frequency:** Which skills appear in 80%+ of target job postings?
2. **Depth:** What advanced features are mentioned (not just "knows K8s")?
3. **Gaps:** What do you have vs what they want?
4. **Differentiation:** What will make you stand out?

**Enhancement Selection Criteria:**
- ✅ Mentioned in majority of job postings
- ✅ Demonstrates senior-level thinking
- ✅ Realistic to build (not months of work)
- ✅ Impressive in portfolio
- ✅ Builds on existing knowledge

---

### Expected Outcomes After Enhancements

**Current Portfolio State (After K8s):**
- 5/8 top skills with basic implementation
- 75% ready for mid-level roles
- Good foundation but lacks depth

**Enhanced Portfolio State:**
- 5/8 top skills with **advanced features**
- 90-95% ready for mid-to-senior level roles
- Demonstrates production thinking and problem-solving
- Stands out from junior candidates
- Shows continuous learning and improvement

**Key Differentiators:**
- Not just "can use Docker" but "architected microservices with Docker"
- Not just "deployed to K8s" but "implemented HA multi-region K8s with observability"
- Not just "wrote Terraform" but "designed multi-cloud IaC with DR and cost optimization"

---

### Success Metrics

**Portfolio is enhancement-complete when:**
- [ ] At least 3 projects have advanced features beyond basics
- [ ] Each technology shows production-grade implementation
- [ ] Real-world problems solved and documented
- [ ] Architecture decisions explained
- [ ] All enhancements documented with rationale
- [ ] Portfolio demonstrates senior-level thinking
- [ ] Stand out from 80% of mid-level candidates

---

**Remember:** Quality over quantity. Better to have 3 impressive projects with depth than 10 basic tutorials.

**Next Action:** Complete K8s lab, then return for enhancement planning session.
