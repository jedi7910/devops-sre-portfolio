# GCP SRE Learning Path - 90 Days

## Weeks 1-2: Foundation
**Lab**: Deploy 3-tier app (frontend/API/database) on Compute Engine with load balancer
**Repo Deliverables**:
- Terraform configs for VPC, firewall rules, compute instances, load balancer
- Architecture diagram
- Deployment runbook

## Weeks 3-4: Kubernetes/GKE
**Lab**: Migrate app to GKE with HPA, resource limits, network policies
**Repo Deliverables**:
- K8s manifests
- Helm charts (reuse existing, adapt for GKE)
- GKE cluster Terraform configs
- Deployment documentation

## Weeks 5-6: Observability
**Lab**: Full monitoring - Cloud Monitoring, Prometheus/Grafana, custom metrics, log-based metrics, SLO dashboards, alerting policies
**Repo Deliverables**:
- Dashboard JSONs (both Cloud Monitoring and Grafana)
- Alert policy configs
- SLI/SLO definitions
- Runbooks for each alert

## Weeks 7-8: Reliability Engineering
**Lab**: Chaos experiments (pod failures, latency injection), disaster recovery drill, multi-region setup
**Repo Deliverables**:
- Chaos engineering scripts
- DR procedures and test results
- 3-4 simulated incident post-mortems

## Weeks 9-10: IaC & CI/CD
**Lab**: Terraform modules for GKE + monitoring, GitHub Actions pipeline with GCP deployment
**Repo Deliverables**:
- Reusable Terraform modules
- GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD
- Rollback procedures
- Change management docs

## Weeks 11-12: Production Scenarios
**Lab**: Cost optimization (rightsizing, committed use discounts), security hardening (Workload Identity, Binary Authorization, GKE security best practices), capacity planning
**Repo Deliverables**:
- Cost analysis report with before/after
- Security policies and configs
- Capacity planning models and documentation

## Week 13: Portfolio Polish
**Repo Deliverables**:
- Comprehensive README with architecture decisions
- Lessons learned document
- Demo video or screenshots
- Link all repos together in main portfolio README# GCP SRE Learning Path - 90 Days
