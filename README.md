## 📖 Learning Journey

This portfolio represents a structured progression through DevOps fundamentals:
```
CI/CD Foundations (GitHub Actions, Jenkins)
            ↓
Infrastructure Automation (Terraform)
            ↓
Container Optimization (Docker, Compose)
            ↓
Production Orchestration (Kubernetes, Helm)
            ↓
Automation & Operations (Bash scripts)
```

Each project builds upon previous concepts while introducing production-grade patterns and best practices.

## 🎯 Portfolio Approach

**Focus:** Quality over quantity
- Production-ready implementations vs. basic tutorials
- Multi-environment thinking throughout
- Security and monitoring integrated from the start
- Complete documentation and operational guides

**Not Included (Yet):**
- Monitoring/Observability stack (planned enhancement)
- Python automation utilities (in progress)
- Advanced AWS services (future work)

**Why this approach?**  
Demonstrates depth of understanding in core DevOps skills rather than superficial knowledge across many tools.
